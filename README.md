<h3 align="center">Intelligent System for Analyzing Emotional States in Criminology</h3>

<br><p align="justify">This is an AI-powered system to analyze emotional states in audio recordings of suspects during criminal interrogations.
<br><br>The system utilizes machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), to provides results in the form of a percentage breakdown of six emotional states, along with a graphical representation of the audio waveform for the analyzed recording. The system also includes an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies the process of uploading and analyzing recordings.
<br><br>These features highlight InSAES' potential to enhance criminal investigations by improving accuracy and efficiency in emotion recognition, reducing reliance on subjective human interpretation.</p>
